    "## Motivation\n",
    "This research is inspired by the paper ['Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data' by Ginsberg et Al. (2009)](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v457/n7232/abs/nature07634.html). In this study they show they can estimate the level of influenza by looking at the online searching behavior of people. Online searching behavior in this case is that when people feel sick, they look on the internet for their symptoms. By looking at online search behavior, influenza can be detected early and its impact can be reduced. \n",
    "In our research we want to take a look at another important problem of the present day and try to help solve it using searching behavior. We will investigate whehter we can predict the real unemployment rate in the Netherlands by using Google trends. We hope that the online searching behavior of people, like in the case of influenza, will help reduce the unemployment rate. Google trends data is available the moment it is being produced, while unemployment data often is announced with a certain lag. Thus, suppose that according to the Google trends data the unemployment rate has risen in this period, it might be usefull for policymakers to adapt a certain policy battling the unemployment. This policy can be adapted sooner than normal due to the use of Google trends. In our research we use Google trends to obtain data on the searching behavior of people. We look at the Google trends for words such as 'niewe baan' ('new job') and uwv (which is an institution that helps unemployed people in the Netherlands to find a job).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This study begins with a short summary of the method and the answer to the research question. Then we will give a more detailed explanation about the main assumptions and the data we used. This is followed by the results. We will end this study with a conclusion and discussion.\n",

    "## Method\n",
    "In this assignment we were able to find data about both the unemployment rate in the Netherlands as well as data from Google trends. For the unemployment rate we gathered data from Statistics Netherlands (CBS). For the Google trends we decided to pick 6 words that we think are related with either unemployment or finding a new job. After acquiring the data we calculated an average index of the 6 words we picked. All words got an equal weight. After plotting the average index we made a graph with both the unemployment rate and the index. To find whether we can predict the unemployment rate in the Netherlands using data from Google trends, we plot the data from both the unemployment rate and the Google trends to see whether the data has a comparable trend. Then we try to figure out whether we are able to not only compare the historic trends, but also see if we can use the historic data to predict the future. We do this by regressing the Google trends on the unemployment and using these coefficients to predict the future. **(??)**\n",

We have choosen 6 words, some of them indicate searches for unemployment benefits and others indicate searches for a new job. We decided to use the following words: 'nieuwe baan' ('new job'), 'CV' ('resume'), 'vacatures' ('vacancies'), 'uwv' (an institution that helps unemployed people in the Netherlands to find a job), 'uitkering' ('social security') and 'werkloos' ('unemployed'). For all words, we checked whether they could be associated with something different than unemployment. We found that this was only the case for 'CV' as people searching for this term also sometimes meant to search for boilers which are CV ketels in Dutch. To make sure that we only used the data of people that were searching for resume, we specified the 'CV' Google trend to the category 'vacancies and education'. As for the unemployment rate we looked at the data from 2010 to 2015 in the Netherlands.\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fluctuation\n",
    "Google trends fluctuate much and because of this our Google trends index has much more peaks and dips than the unemployment rate. We believe this is because unemployment rates are mcuh less easier to change than the amount of people looking at specific topics on Google, so the Google trends data is much more volatile than the unemploment rate. It would be beneficial to our research if we would be able to smooth the data that we obtained from Google trends in order to make it easier to compare it with the unemployment rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search patterns\n",
    "The use of Google trends also comes with a negative side. It could be that instead of solely people who are unemployed or on the verge of becoming unemployed, people who are suddenly interested in the topic search for 'uitkering' for example. This could be due to some popular polician mentioning something about this topic. This could spike the Google trends, and thus spike the predicted unemployment but may have no effect on the actual unemployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Policy advice\n",
    "We would advice policy makers to use Google trends to be able to react to changes in the unemployment rate more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future research\n",
    "It would be even more beneficial to policymakers to be able to actually predict the unemployment in the coming period with the Google trends of today. However, due to our time constraint we were not able to implement a model that is able to predict the future unemployment with current trends. One option to do this would be to make use of the program Scikit. This would be interesting for future research.\n",
